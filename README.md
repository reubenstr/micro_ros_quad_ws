Quadruped Robot for ROS2 

This is a workspace for upgrading the OpenQuadruped into the ROS2 framework. A goal is simplifying and drying the original source code and removing experiemental code. Work in progress. 

See the dev-notes folder for installation steps (not intended as a tutorial as many already exist).
