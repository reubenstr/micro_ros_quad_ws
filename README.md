# quad_ws
ROS2 workspace Zuko, a robot dog! 

### Status

<<<<<<< HEAD
Inactive.

For the active workspace visit: https://github.com/reubenstr/rpi_quad_ws

### Notes

This workspace uses ROS2 Teensy 4.0 with micro-ros to drive a robot dog. Although this workspace is inactive, the code base is a working example of ROS2 and micro-ros interaction.

See the main project for Zuko's CAD files, PCB's, media, and more, https://github.com/reubenstr/Zuko

Inactive

See the rpi_quad_ws for active development: https://github.com/reubenstr/rpi_quad_ws

### Notes

This workspace is a modified OpenQuadruped ROS1 upgraded into the ROS2 framework. 

Servos are controlled by a Teensy 4.0 which uses micro_ros: https://micro.ros.org/

Code functions and allows joystick input through the kinematic model into the Teensy for robot control using ROS2 and micro_ros.
