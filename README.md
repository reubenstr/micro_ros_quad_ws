Quadruped Robot for ROS2 

### Status

Inactive

See the rpi_quad_ws for active development: https://github.com/reubenstr/rpi_quad_ws

### Notes

This workspace is a modified OpenQuadruped ROS1 upgraded into the ROS2 framework. 

Servos are controlled by a Teensy 4.0 which uses micro_ros: https://micro.ros.org/

Code functions and allows joystick input through the kinematic model into the Teensy for robot control using ROS2 and micro_ros.
